Bootloader based on Atmel application note AVR109 communication protocol
Target chips: ATmega168/328

The bootloader expects to receive the '@' character in the first
5 seconds after reset and enters the bootloader mode and
responds with a '\r' character.
If the above condition is not met, execution starts from address 0.

It can be tested with the included avr109test.exe program.

Modify the definitions for SPM control from defines.h to suit your chip.

Example, for ATmega328:
#define	SPMCR_REG	SPMCSR
#asm
     #define WR_SPMCR_REG_R22 out 0x37,r22
#endasm

Chip clock frequency: 16MHz specified in the project configuration.
