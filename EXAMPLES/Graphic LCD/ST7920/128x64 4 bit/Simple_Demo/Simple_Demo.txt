The ST7920 controller is interfaced to the
AVR chip in 4 bit mode.

The program is designed to be compiled with the Evaluation
version, so it's capabilities are limited.

The demo is designed to run on any ATmega328P
development board with chip clock of 16 MHz.
(Arduino Uno board)

A CX12864B-1 128x64 pixels graphic LCD module was used.

The LCD module to Arduino Uno connections are:
 7 DB0  - not connected
 8 DB1  - not connected
 9 DB2  - not connected
10 DB3  - not connected
11 DB4  - PORTD bit 0 (Digital 0)
12 DB5  - PORTD bit 1 (Digital 1)
13 DB6  - PORTD bit 2 (Digital 2)
14 DB7  - PORTD bit 3 (Digital 3)

 6 E    - PORTD bit 4 (Digital 4)
 5 R/W  - PORTD bit 5 (Digital 5)
 4 RS   - PORTD bit 6 (Digital 6)
17 /RST - PORTD bit 7 (Digital 7)

15 PSB  - +5V

 1 VSS  - GND
