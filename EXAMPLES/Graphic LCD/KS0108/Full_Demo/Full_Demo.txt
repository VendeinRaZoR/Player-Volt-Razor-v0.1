The program shows the capabilities of some of the most
important functions of the CodeVisionAVR's graphic library.

The demo is designed to run on any ATmega128A
development board with chip clock of 16 MHz.

The 128x64 graphic LCD module connections are:
DB0    - PORTA bit 0
DB1    - PORTA bit 1
DB2    - PORTA bit 2
DB3    - PORTA bit 3
DB4    - PORTA bit 4
DB5    - PORTA bit 5
DB6    - PORTA bit 6
DB7    - PORTA bit 7

E      - PORTC bit 0
R/W    - PORTC bit 1
RS     - PORTC bit 2
RESET  - PORTC bit 3
CS1    - PORTC bit 4
CS2    - PORTC bit 5

Important Note: There are several kinds of 128x64
pixels KS0108 LCD modules.
Some of them have active high Chip Select signals
(CS1, CS2), while others have active low Chip
Select signals (/CS1, /CS2).
Make sure to select the correct display type in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

The LCD module contrast control voltage must be supplied
as specified in it's datasheet.

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATmega128A FLASH with
the contents of the
