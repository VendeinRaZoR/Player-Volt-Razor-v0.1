The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlain development board with chip clock of 32 MHz.

A Powertip SE12864LRF-042-H-Q display was used for testing.

The 128x64 graphic LCD module connections are:
SCL    - PORTA bit 6
SI     - PORTA bit 7

A0     - PORTD bit 3
/RES   - PORTD bit 4
/CS    - PORTD bit 5

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\ST7565 Serial\Full_Demo\Exe\Full_Demo.hex
file.
