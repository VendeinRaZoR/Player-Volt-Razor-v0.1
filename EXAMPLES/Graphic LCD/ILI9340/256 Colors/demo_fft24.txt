This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the
glcd_ili9340.lib file is supplied only with the
Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\ILI9340\256 Colors\Exe\demo_fft24.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A type NHD-2.4-240320SF-CTXI-F1 (older variant with ILI9340)
240x320 2.4" TFT LCD module from www.newhavendisplay.com
is used for the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the ILI9340 controller.

In this demo the controller is operated in 256 color mode
using a 8 bit interface .

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - GND
DB1  - GND
DB2  - GND
DB3  - GND
DB4  - GND
DB5  - GND
DB6  - GND
DB7  - GND

DB8  - PORTA bit 0
DB9  - PORTA bit 1
DB10 - PORTA bit 2
DB11 - PORTA bit 3
DB12 - PORTA bit 4
DB13 - PORTA bit 5
DB14 - PORTA bit 6
DB15 - PORTA bit 7

/CS  - PORTD bit 0
RS (D/C) - PORTD bit 1
/RD  - PORTD bit 2
/WR  - PORTD bit 3
/RST - PORTD bit 4

IM0  - +3.3V Use 8 bit interface mode

Backlight connections:
LED-A  - +3.3V
LED-K1 - connected to GND using a 470 ohm resistor
LED-K2 - connected to GND using a 470 ohm resistor
LED-K3 - connected to GND using a 470 ohm resistor
LED-K4 - connected to GND using a 470 ohm resistor

Power supply connections:
GND   - GND
VDD   - +3.3V
IOVDD - +3.3V

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
