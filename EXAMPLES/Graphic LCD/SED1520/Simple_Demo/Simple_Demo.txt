The program is designed to be compiled with the Evaluation
version, so it's capabilities are limited.

The demo is designed to run on any ATmega128A
development board with chip clock of 16 MHz.

The 122x32 graphic LCD module connections are:
DB0    - PORTA bit 0
DB1    - PORTA bit 1
DB2    - PORTA bit 2
DB3    - PORTA bit 3
DB4    - PORTA bit 4
DB5    - PORTA bit 5
DB6    - PORTA bit 6
DB7    - PORTA bit 7

RD/WR  - PORTC bit 1
A0     - PORTC bit 2
/RES   - PORTC bit 3
E1     - PORTC bit 4
E2     - PORTC bit 5

CL     - PORTB bit 4 (if needed)

Some displays require an external 2kHz clock signal CL.
This signal, generated by ATmega128A Timer/Counter 0,
will be available on PORTB bit 4.

Important Note: There are two kinds of 122x32
pixels SED1520 LCD modules.
Some of them have active high Enable signals
(E1, E2) and single RD/WR signal,
while others have active low Chip Select signals
(/CS1, /CS2) and separate /RD and /WR signals.
Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

The LCD module contrast control voltage must be supplied
as specified in it's datasheet.
