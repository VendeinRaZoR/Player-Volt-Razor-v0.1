The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlain development board with chip clock of 32 MHz.

The 128x64 graphic LCD module connections are:
DB0    - PORTA bit 0
DB1    - PORTA bit 1
DB2    - PORTA bit 2
DB3    - PORTA bit 3
DB4    - PORTA bit 4
DB5    - PORTA bit 5
DB6    - PORTA bit 6
DB7    - PORTA bit 7

A0     - PORTD bit 3
/RES   - PORTD bit 4
/CS    - PORTD bit 5
/RD    - PORTD bit 6
/WR    - PORTD bit 7

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
