This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ssd1963.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\Resistive Touchscreen\SSD1963 800x480\Release\Exe\demo_rtouch_800_480.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A 800x480 7" TFT LCD module is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the SSD1963 controller.

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTC bit 0
DB1  - PORTC bit 1
DB2  - PORTC bit 2
DB3  - PORTC bit 3
DB4  - PORTC bit 4
DB5  - PORTC bit 5
DB6  - PORTC bit 6
DB7  - PORTC bit 7

DB8  - PORTA bit 0
DB9  - PORTA bit 1
DB10 - PORTA bit 2
DB11 - PORTA bit 3
DB12 - PORTA bit 4
DB13 - PORTA bit 5
DB14 - PORTA bit 6
DB15 - PORTA bit 7

/CS  - PORTB bit 3
D/C  - PORTB bit 0
/RD  - PORTB bit 2
/WR  - PORTB bit 1
/RST - PORTD bit 2

Backlight PWM - PORTD bit 1

GND   - GND
+3.3V - +3.3V
+5V   - +5V

ADS7846 touch screen controller connections:
/CS     - PORTE bit 1
DCLK    - PORTE bit 0
DIN     - PORTE bit 2
DOUT    - PORTE bit 3
/PENIRQ - PORTD bit 0

FLASH chip is not used in this demo
FCS (/CS) - +3.3V

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic Display and
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Resistive Touchscreen
menus.
