This example can't be compiled with the Evaluation version
of CodeVisionAVR because of the program size.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\S6D1121\256 Colors\Release\Exe\demo_fft24.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained
development board with an ATxmega128A1 chip using the internal 32 MHz
oscillator as clock source.

A 240x320 2.4" TFT LCD module is used for the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the S6D1121 controller.

In this demo the controller is operated in 256 color mode
using an 8-bit bus connection.

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - GND
DB1  - GND
DB2  - GND
DB3  - GND
DB4  - GND
DB5  - GND
DB6  - GND
DB7  - GND

DB8  - PORTA bit 0
DB9  - PORTA bit 1
DB10 - PORTA bit 2
DB11 - PORTA bit 3
DB12 - PORTA bit 4
DB13 - PORTA bit 5
DB14 - PORTA bit 6
DB15 - PORTA bit 7

/WR  - PORTD bit 3
/RD  - PORTD bit 2
RS   - PORTD bit 1
/RST - PORTD bit 4
/CS  - PORTD bit 0

Backlight connections:
GND   - GND
LED-A - 100 ohm resistor to +3.3V

Power supply connections:
GND - GND
VCC - +3.3V

The J1 jumper on the PCB must be set in order
to bypass the on-board voltage regulator
and use the external 3.3V power supply.
The J3 jumper on the PCB must be left opened
in order to use the 8-bit interface.
Details are in the included schematic.

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
