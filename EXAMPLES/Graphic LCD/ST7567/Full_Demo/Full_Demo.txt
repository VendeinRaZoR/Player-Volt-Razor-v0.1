The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlain development board with chip clock of 32 MHz.

A Winstar WO12864H-TFH# 128x64 graphic LCD module is used.
The connections are:
DB0    - PORTA bit 0
DB1    - PORTA bit 1
DB2    - PORTA bit 2
DB3    - PORTA bit 3
DB4    - PORTA bit 4
DB5    - PORTA bit 5
DB6    - PORTA bit 6
DB7    - PORTA bit 7

A0     - PORTD bit 3
/RES   - PORTD bit 4
/CS    - PORTD bit 5
/RD    - PORTD bit 6
/WR    - PORTD bit 7

PSB    - +3.3V
C86    - GND
VG     - 2.2uF capacitor to GND
XV0    - 2.2uF capacitor to V0
VSS    - GND
VDD    - +3.3V

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
