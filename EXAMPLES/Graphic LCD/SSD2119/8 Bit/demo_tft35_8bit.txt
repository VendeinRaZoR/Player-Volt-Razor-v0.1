This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ssd2119.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\SSD2119\8 Bit\Exe\demo_tft35_8bit.hex
file.

In this demo the SSD2119 controller operates in 
8 bit interface mode.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel Xplain
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A large portion of the program (51712 bytes)
consists of the uncompressed 186x139 64k color
image from the file image.c
Due to the limited number of I/O pins of the Xplain
board, there was no possibility to connect a SD CARD
and store this image on it, so for the purpose of this demo,
it was located in chip's FLASH memory.
The image was left uncompressed in order to allow fast loading.

A generic 320x240 3.5" TFT LCD module is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the SSD2119 controller. 

The TFT LCD module connections are:

RS (D/C)      - PORTA bit 1
/WR           - PORTA bit 2
/RD           - PORTA bit 3
/RESET (/RST) - PORTA bit 4

8 bit interface selection inputs:
PS0  - +3.3V
PS1  - +3.3V
PS2  - GND

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
