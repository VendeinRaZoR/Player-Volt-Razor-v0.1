The program shows the capabilities of some of the most
important functions of the CodeVisionAVR's graphic library.

The demo is designed to run on any ATmega128A
development board with chip clock of 16 MHz.

The 320x240 graphic LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTA bit 0
DB1  - PORTA bit 1
DB2  - PORTA bit 2
DB3  - PORTA bit 3
DB4  - PORTA bit 4
DB5  - PORTA bit 5
DB6  - PORTA bit 6
DB7  - PORTA bit 7

/WR  - PORTC bit 0
/RD  - PORTC bit 1
A0   - PORTC bit 2
/RST - PORTC bit 3
/CS  - PORTC bit 4

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

The LCD module contrast control voltage must be supplied
as specified in it's datasheet.

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATmega128A FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\S1D13700\Full_Demo\Exe\Full_Demo.hex
file.
