Data Stack Size: 512 bytes
Development board: Arduino UNO

- Connect the cathodes of 8 LEDs to the outputs marked DIGITAL 0..7 on the board.
  These outputs correspond to PORTD pins PD0..PD7 of the microcontroller.
- Connect each LED’s anode, using a 1k resistor, to the pin marked 5V of
  the board’s POWER connector header.
- Connect the USB connector of the Arduino UNO board to an USB port of your computer.
  This will provide serial communication and power supply to the board.
- Open the Project|Configure|After Build menu and select the correct COM
  port used for communication with the Arduino UNO board.
- Do Project|Build All and press the Program the Chip button in
  the Information window that will be displayed after build.
