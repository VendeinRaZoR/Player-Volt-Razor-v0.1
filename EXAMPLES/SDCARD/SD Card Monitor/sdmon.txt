MMC/SD/SD HC card debug monitor example for the CodeVisionAVR V2.05.1+ compiler

The program is based on FAT file system sample project
for FatFs R0.07 (C)ChaN, 2008-2009

Modified & debugged by Pavel Haiduc, (C) 2009-2011 HP InfoTech s.r.l.

The example is intended to be run on the Mega128-Dev development board
from www.priio.com.
The development board uses an ATmega128 chip running at 14.745600 MHz

The SD card socket on the development board is connected to the
following I/O ports:

SD socket    CD4050    ATmega128
pin1  /CS -----<|----- PORTD bit6
pin2  SI  -----<|----- MOSI
pin3  GND
pin4  +3.3V
pin5  SCK -----<|----- SCK
pin6  GND
pin7  SO  ------------ MISO
pin9  GND
pin10 /CD ------------ PORTG bit4 with 10k pull-up resistor to +5V
pin11 WP  ------------ PORTG bit3 with 10k pull-up resistor to +5V
pin12 GND

The CD4050 CMOS buffer is powered from a +3.3V supply and
performs logic level translation from 5V (AVR) to 3.3V (SD card).

For other I/O port connections, you need to make appropriate changes in the
"Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|MMC/SD/SD HC Card and FAT Support"
menu.

The development board also uses a PCF8563 RTC connected to the
following I/O ports:

PCF8563                ATmega128
pin5 SDA ------------- PORTD bit1 with 10k pull-up resistor to +5V
pin6 SCL ------------- PORTD bit0 with 10k pull-up resistor to +5V

These connections are specified in the 
"Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|I2C" menu.

The development board's serial socket P9 must be connected to the PC COM port.
The CodeVisionAVR Terminal is used for displaying data received from the
development board.
The Terminal must be configured for:
Baud Rate: 19200
Data Bits: 8
Parity: None
Stop Bits: 1
Emulation: TTY
Handshaking: None
Append LF on Reception: OFF
Appearance|Rows: 40
Appearance|Columns: 80

If you are using the CodeVisionAVR Evaluation version, you may program into
the FLASH the precompiled SDMON.HEX file found in the
\Examples\SD Card Monitor\EXE directory
