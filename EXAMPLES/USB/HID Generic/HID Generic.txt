CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.11 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel AT90USBKEY development board, using
an AT90USB1287 chip running at 8.000000 MHz.

In order to use this example, the
'Generic Hid Test.exe' program must be
launched on the PC.
This program requires the .NET framework 4.0
to be installed on the computer.
It can be downloaded from:

Note: The source code for the 'Generic Hid Test.exe' program
is supplied only with the commercial versions of CodeVisionAVR.

The AT90USBKEY, programmed with this example's
code, must be connected to an USB port of the PC.

The 'Generic Hid Test' program will display the
report data sent by the AT90USBKEY to the PC host.

Checking the LED boxes in the 'Generic Hid Test'
program, will send report data to the USB device
and will light the appropriate LEDs on the
AT90USBKEY board.
The LEDs are connected to PORTD bit 4..7 outputs.
