CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.11 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel AT90USBKEY development board, using
an AT90USB1287 chip running at 8.000000 MHz.

The AT90USBKEY, programmed with this example's
code, must be connected to an USB port of the PC.

After the HID mouse device is detected,
the mouse cursor will be moved in a triangular
shape on the screen.

The LED5.2, connected to PORTD bit 7 output,
will be lighted during mouse cursor movement.
