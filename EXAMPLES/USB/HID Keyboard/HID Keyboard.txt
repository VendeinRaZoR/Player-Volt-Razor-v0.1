CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.11 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel AT90USBKEY development board, using
an AT90USB1287 chip running at 8.000000 MHz.

The AT90USBKEY, programmed with this example's
code, must be connected to an USB port of the PC.

Open a new file in the CodeVisionAVR editor
and click with the mouse in the editor window,
so that the caret will displayed.

After the HID keyboard is detected by the PC,
joystick movements on the AT90USBKEY board will be
translated to key inputs in the editor window:

left   -> 'l' or 'L' key
right  -> 'r' or 'R' key
up     -> 'u' or 'U' key
down   -> 'd' or 'D' key
select -> toggle Caps Lock on/off.

Board's LEDs will display keyboard status.
