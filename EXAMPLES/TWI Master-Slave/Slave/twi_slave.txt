Example program for I2C bus communication
as a slave using TWI

CodeVisionAVR V2.05.1+ C Compiler

Chip: ATmega328P
Memory Model: SMALL
Data Stack Size: 512 bytes
Clock frequency: 16.0 MHz
   
The master will transmit packets of
data to the slave using the I2C bus.
The slave will respond back through the I2C bus
with a confirmation message.
The slave will also display the contents
of the received data packets on a 16x2 LCD
connected as outlined below:
   
[LCD]    [AVR]
1 GND - GND
2 +5V - VCC  
3 VLC - LCD contrast control voltage 0..1V
4 RS  - PB0
5 RD  - GND
6 EN  - PB1
11 D4  - PD4
12 D5  - PD5
13 D6  - PD6
14 D7  - PD7

The LCD connections are specified in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Alphanumeric menu

I2C bus port bits allocations for TWI on PORTC:
SDA=bit 4, SCL=bit 5
These signals must be connected to the corresponding
SDA and SCL signals of the I2C master board.  
   
NOTE: 3.3k..4.7k PULL-UP RESITORS TO +5V MUST
BE USED FOR THE SDA & SCL I2C BUS SIGNALS
