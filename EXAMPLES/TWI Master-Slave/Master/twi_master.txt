Example program for I2C bus communication
as a master using TWI

CodeVisionAVR V2.05.1+ C Compiler

Chip: ATmega328P
Memory Model: SMALL
Data Stack Size: 512 bytes
Clock frequency: 16.0 MHz
   
The master will transmit packets of
data to the slave using the I2C bus.
The slave will respond back through the I2C bus
with a confirmation message, which will be
then transmitted by the master development
board by RS232 to a COM port of the PC. 
      
The CodeVisionAVR Terminal can be used to
display this message.

Serial communication parameters: 9600 8N1

I2C bus port bits allocations for TWI on PORTC:
SDA=bit 4, SCL=bit 5
These signals must be connected to the corresponding
SDA and SCL signals of the I2C slave board.  
   
NOTE: 3.3k..4.7k PULL-UP RESITORS TO +5V MUST
BE USED FOR THE SDA & SCL I2C BUS SIGNALS
