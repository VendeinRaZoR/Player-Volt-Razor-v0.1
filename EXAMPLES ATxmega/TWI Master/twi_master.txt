Sample program to test the ATxmega128A1 TWID and USARTC0

Copyright (C) 2010 Pavel Haiduc and HP InfoTech S.R.L.,

A Maxim/Dallas Semiconductor DS1621 Digital Thermometer
and Thermostat is connected to the TWID interface.
The measured temperature is serialy outputed using USARTC0
and displayed on the CodeVisionAVR Terminal.

NOTE: AS THE TWIX LIBRARY IS NOT SUPPLIED WITH THE
EVALUATION VERSION OF CODEVISIONAVR, THIS PROJECT
CAN'T BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPILED WITH THIS VERSION

In order to test the code functionality,
use the Tools|Programmer to program the ATxmega128A1
FLASH with the contents of the \Exe\twi_master.rom file.
 
Use a STK600 development board with STK600-TQFP100 and
STK600-RC100X-13 addapters

The STK600 programmer must be set in JTAG programming mode
in the Tools|Programmer menu.

Make sure that the VTARGET and VREF voltages are set to 3.6V
using AVR Studio.
The VTARGET LED on the STK600 board must be lighted.

Make the following connections on the STK600:

PC3 - RS232 SPARE TXD
PD0 - DS1621 SDA pin 1 - 4.7K resistor to VTG
PD1 - DS1621 SCL pin 2 - 4.7K resistor to VTG
GND - DS1621 GND pin 4
GND - DS1621 A0 pin 7
GND - DS1621 A1 pin 6
GND - DS1621 A2 pin 5
VTG - DS1621 VDD pin 8.

Connect the STK600 RS232 output to the COM port of the PC.
Make sure to configure the CodeVisionAVR Terminal
to 9600bps 8N1, Append LF on reception: disabled.
