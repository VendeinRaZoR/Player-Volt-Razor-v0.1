Sample program to test the ATxmega128A1 ADC in 12 Bit unsigned
event triggered interrupt mode.

Timer/Counter TCC0 will overflow every 1000ms and will
create an event on event channels 0..3, which will
trigger AD conversions on ADCA channels 0..3.

After the AD conversion will be complete for a channel,
it's interrupt service routine will display the result.
This approach can be used since the time interval between
two conversions for a channel is quite large (1000ms)
and the printf function has enough time to complete.
If the time interval between two conversions for a channel
is small, the printf must be removed from the interrupt
service routine and conversion data just stored in a
global array, in order to be displayed at a later stage.
 
The chip is clocked from the internal 2MHz RC oscillator.

Use a STK600 development board with STK600-TQFP100 and
STK600-RC100X-13 addapters

The STK600 programmer must be set in JTAG programming mode
in the Tools|Programmer menu.

Make sure that the VTARGET and VREF voltages are set to 3.6V
using AVR Studio.
The VTARGET LED on the STK600 board must be lighted.

Make the following connections on the STK600
PC3 - RS232 SPARE TXD.

Connect the STK600 RS232 output to the COM port of the PC
Make sure to configure the CodeVisionAVR Terminal
to 9600bps 8N1.

DC voltage in the 0-1.0V range must be applied between the
PORTA pins ADC0, ADC1 and ADC3 (used by ADC channels 0, 1
and 2) and GND.
ADC channel 3 is used to read the voltage of the
internal temperature reference.

The PORTA ADC7 pin must be connected to GND, because it is
used to read the ADC offset voltage, that must be compensated.
