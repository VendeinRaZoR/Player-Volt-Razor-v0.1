Sample program to test the ATxmega TWIC master and
TWID slave operation.

Copyright (C) 2010 Pavel Haiduc and HP InfoTech S.R.L.,

If one or several switches SW0..SW7 are pressed
on the STK600 board, their state is transmitted
by the TWIC master to the TWID slave, which
displays the received data on the LED0..LED7.
The slave sends to the master the contents of the
test_data array.

NOTE: AS THE TWIX LIBRARY IS NOT SUPPLIED WITH THE
EVALUATION VERSION OF CODEVISIONAVR, THIS PROJECT
CAN'T BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPILED WITH THIS VERSION

In order to test the code functionality,
use the Tools|Programmer to program the ATxmega128A1
FLASH with the contents of the \Exe\twi_slave.rom file.
 
Use a STK600 development board with STK600-TQFP100 and
STK600-RC100X-13 addapters

The STK600 programmer must be set in JTAG programming mode
in the Tools|Programmer menu.

Make sure that the VTARGET and VREF voltages are set to 3.6V
using AVR Studio.
The VTARGET LED on the STK600 board must be lighted.

Make the following connections on the STK600:

PC0 - PD0 SDA pin - 4.7K resistor to VTG
PC1 - PD1 SCL pin - 4.7K resistor to VTG
SW0..SW7 - PE0..PE7 using a ribbon cable with 10 pin connectors
LED0..LED7 - PA0..PA7 using a ribbon cable with 10 pin connectors.
