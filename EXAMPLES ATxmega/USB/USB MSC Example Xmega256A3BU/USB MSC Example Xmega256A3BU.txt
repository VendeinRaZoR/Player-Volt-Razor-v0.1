 This example shows how to implement a USB Device Mass Storage
 on Atmel MCU with USB module on a XMEGA-A3BU Xplained board.

 The example uses all memories available on the board and connects these to
 USB Device Mass Storage stack. After loading firmware, connect the
 XMEGA-A3BU Xplained board to the USB Host. When connected to a USB host system
 this application allows to display all available memories as a
 removable disks in the Unix/Mac/Windows operating systems.
 
 This example uses the native MSC driver on Unix/Mac/Windows OS, except for Win98.

 The example uses the following module groups:
 - Basic modules:
   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 - USB Device stack and MSC modules:
   services/usb/
   services/usb/udc/
   services/usb/class/msc/
 - Specific implementation:
    - main.c,
      initializes clock
      initializes interrupt
      manages UI
    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (leds)

 The memory data transfers are done outside USB interrupt routine.
 This is done in the MSC process ("udi_msc_process_trans()") called by main loop.
