USB CDC Example based on Atmel ASF code.
The example is designed to be compiled with the
CodeVisionAVR V3.03 or later compiler.
The target chip is ATxmega128A4U.

Setup for STK600:
- LEDS connector is connected to PORTA
- SWITCHES are connected to PORTB
- PC2 (RXC0) is connected to RS232 SPARE RXD
- PC3 (TXC0) is connected to RS232 SPARE TXD
- Warning! The AREF1 jumper must be removed
  because AREF1 connected on PORTB0 overrides switch 0.

Human interface on STK600:
- Led 0 is on when USB line is in IDLE mode, and off in SUSPEND mode
- Led 1 blinks when USB host has checked and enabled CDC interface
- Led 2 is on when CDC port is open
- Led 4 is on during data transfer from CDC to UART
- Led 5 is on during data transfer from UART to CDC
- Led 6 signals an frame error on UART
- Led 7 signals an overflow

Connect the STK600 USB port to your PC.
Install the 'atmel_devices_cdc.inf' driver located in the
...\EXAMPLES ATxmega\USB\USB CDC Example Xmega128A4U
directory.
After the driver is installed go to Windows 7 
Control Panel|Devices and Printers.
The 'Communication Device Class ASF Example' should
be listed there along with the associated COM port number.
Open a Terminal program (for example PuTTY from:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
and select this COM port with Baud rate: 115200 and
communication parameters 8N1.

Connect the STK600 RS232 port to your PC.
In the CodeVisionAVR IDE go to Settings|Terminal
and select the COM port used for RS232, the
Baud rate: 115200, communication parameters 8N1,
enable Echo Transmitted Characters.
Start the CodeVisionAVR Terminal using Tools|Terminal.
In the CodeVisionAVR Terminal press the Connect button.
Then type some text in the Terminal window.

This text will be transmitted using the USB CDC serial
port and displayed in the Windows Terminal program.
