 ATxmega EBI SDRAM example for the Atmel XPLAIN and XMEGA-A1 Xplained 
 boards and the CodeVisionAVR V3.04 or later compilers
 (C) Copyright 2010-2013 Pavel Haiduc, HP InfoTech s.r.l.  
 
 Chip Type: ATxmega128A1 running from the 32MHz internal oscillator
 The EBI configuration is specified in the
 Project|Configure|C Compiler|EBI Settings menu
 
 The SDRAM settings are:
 
 CAS Latency: 3 x2 ClkPer cycles 
 Row bits: 12 
 Column bits: 10 
 Mode Register Delay: 2 x2 ClkPer cycles  
 Row Cycle Delay: 7 x2 ClkPer cycles  
 Row to Pre-charge Delay: 7 x2 ClkPer cycles  
 Write Recovery Delay: 1 x2 ClkPer cycles  
 Exit Self Refresh to Active Delay: 7 x2 ClkPer cycles  
 Row to Column Delay: 7 x2 ClkPer cycles  
 Refresh Period: 1023 x2 ClkPer cycles (64 us @ 32MHz). 
 Initialization Delay: 4096 x2 ClkPer cycles (256 us @ 32MHz). 
 
 All EBI initialization is performed automatically by
 CodeVisionAVR in the startup code
 
 The SDRAM connections are:
 
 PORTK[7:0] - A[7:0]
 PORTJ[7:0] - {A[11:8],D[3:0]}
 PORTH[7:0] - {WE,CAS,RAS,DQM,BA0,BA1,CKE,CLK}   
 Note: The SDRAM /CS signal is permanently connected to GND
