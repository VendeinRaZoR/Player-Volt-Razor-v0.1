The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlained development board with chip clock of 32 MHz.

A Densitron DD-12864YW-13A 128x64 OLED display module was
used for the purpose of this demo.

The display module connections using the 8080 parallel interface are:
DB0    - PORTA bit 0
DB1    - PORTA bit 1
DB2    - PORTA bit 2
DB3    - PORTA bit 3
DB4    - PORTA bit 4
DB5    - PORTA bit 5
DB6    - PORTA bit 6
DB7    - PORTA bit 7

/RD    - PORTD bit 0
/WR    - PORTD bit 1
D/C    - PORTD bit 2
/CS    - PORTD bit 3
/RES   - PORTD bit 4
Vcc ON - PORTD bit 5 enables the 15V Vcc DC/DC converter

BS0    - GND
BS1    - +3.3V

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\SSD1322\Full Demo\Release\Exe\Full Demo.hex
file.
