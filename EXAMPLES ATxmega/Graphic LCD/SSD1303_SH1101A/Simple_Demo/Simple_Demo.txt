The program is designed to be compiled with the Evaluation
version, so it's capabilities are limited.

The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlain development board with chip clock of 2 MHz.

A Bolymin BL12864G 128x64 OLED display module was
used for the purpose of this demo.

The display module connections are:
4  DB0    - PORTA bit 0
5  DB1    - PORTA bit 1
6  DB2    - PORTA bit 2
7  DB3    - PORTA bit 3
8  DB4    - PORTA bit 4
9  DB5    - PORTA bit 5
10 DB6    - PORTA bit 6
11 DB7    - PORTA bit 7

16 D/C    - PORTD bit 3
14 /RES   - PORTD bit 4
12 /CS    - PORTD bit 5
17 /RD    - PORTD bit 6
15 /WR    - PORTD bit 7

1  Vdd    - +3.3V from power supply (140mA)
2  Vss    - GND

19 DISP   - +3.3V

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
