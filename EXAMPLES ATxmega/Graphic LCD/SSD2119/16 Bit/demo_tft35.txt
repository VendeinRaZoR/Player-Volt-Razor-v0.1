This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ssd2119.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\SSD2119\16 Bit\Exe\demo_tft35.hex
file.

A large portion of the program (51712 bytes)
consists of the uncompressed 186x139 64k color
image from the file image.c
The image was left uncompressed in order to
allow fast loading.

In this demo the SSD2119 controller operates in 
16 bit interface mode.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A generic 320x240 3.5" TFT LCD module is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the SSD2119 controller. 

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTD bit 0
DB1  - PORTD bit 1
DB2  - PORTD bit 2
DB3  - PORTD bit 3
DB4  - PORTD bit 4
DB5  - PORTD bit 5
DB6  - PORTD bit 6
DB7  - PORTD bit 7

DB8  - PORTE bit 0
DB9  - PORTE bit 1
DB10 - PORTE bit 2
DB11 - PORTE bit 3
DB12 - PORTE bit 4
DB13 - PORTE bit 5
DB14 - PORTE bit 6
DB15 - PORTE bit 7

/CS           - PORTC bit 0
RS (D/C)      - PORTC bit 1
/WR           - PORTC bit 2
/RD           - PORTC bit 3
/RESET (/RST) - PORTC bit 4

16 bit interface selection inputs:
PS0  - GND
PS1  - +3.3V
PS2  - GND
PS3  - GND

Power supply connections:
GND  - GND
3V3  - +3.3V

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
