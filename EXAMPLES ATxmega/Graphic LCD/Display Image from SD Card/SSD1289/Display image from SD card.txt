Solomon Systech SSD1289 Color TFT LCD controller demo.
Display an image stored in a binary file on a SD card.

The image was imported from a JPG PC file and
converted to a binary format, compatible with the
CodeVisionAVR graphic library, using the LCD Vision software.

The converted "image.bin" file from the project directory
must be copied to the SD card, so that it can be read
by this example program. 

This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ssd1289.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES ATXmega\Graphic LCD\Display Image from SD Card\SSD1289\Exe\Display image from SD card.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A Micro SD card socket is connected to the development board
as outlined below:

Card Socket
/CS ------------ PORTF bit 4
SI  ------------ PORTF bit 5 MOSI
SO  ------------ PORTF bit 6 MISO
SCK ------------ PORTF bit 7 SCK
GND ------------ GND
+3.3V ---------- +3.3V

The /CD and WP signals are disabled in the project configuration,
because a Micro SD card socket without these signals was used.

For other I/O port connections, you need to make the appropriate changes in the
"Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|MMC/SD/SD HC Card and FAT Support"
menu.

A 240x320 HY32D 3.2" TFT LCD module is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the SSD1289 controller. 

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTE bit 0
DB1  - PORTE bit 1
DB2  - PORTE bit 2
DB3  - PORTE bit 3
DB4  - PORTE bit 4
DB5  - PORTE bit 5
DB6  - PORTE bit 6
DB7  - PORTE bit 7

DB8  - PORTC bit 0
DB9  - PORTC bit 1
DB10 - PORTC bit 2
DB11 - PORTC bit 3
DB12 - PORTC bit 4
DB13 - PORTC bit 5
DB14 - PORTC bit 6
DB15 - PORTC bit 7

/WR  - PORTD bit 3
/RD  - PORTD bit 2
D/C  - PORTD bit 1
/RST - PORTD bit 4
/CS  - PORTD bit 0

Backlight connections:
BLGND - GND
BLVDD - +3.3V

Power supply connections:
GND - GND
+5V - +5V

If you are using a different LCD module than HY32D,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
