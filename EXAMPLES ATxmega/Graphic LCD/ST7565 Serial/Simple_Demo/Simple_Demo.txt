The program is designed to be compiled with the Evaluation
version, so it's capabilities are limited.

The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlain development board with chip clock of 2 MHz.

A Powertip SE12864LRF-042-H-Q display was used for testing.

The 128x64 graphic LCD module connections are:
SCL    - PORTA bit 6
SI     - PORTA bit 7

A0     - PORTD bit 3
/RES   - PORTD bit 4
/CS    - PORTD bit 5

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
