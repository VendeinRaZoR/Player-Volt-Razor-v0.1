The program is designed to be compiled with the Evaluation
version, so it's capabilities are limited.

The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlain development board with chip clock of 2 MHz.

An AGG240128A05-FHW-R 240x128 graphic LCD module
from Shenzen AV-Display Co. Ltd. is used for the
purpose of this demo.
The UC1608 controller is used in serial mode connection.

The graphic LCD module connections are:
