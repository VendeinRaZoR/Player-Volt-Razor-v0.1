The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlain development board with chip clock of 32 MHz.

An AGG240128A05-FHW-R 240x128 graphic LCD module
from Shenzen AV-Display Co. Ltd. is used for the
purpose of this demo.
The UC1608 controller is used in 4-bit parallel
mode connection.

The graphic LCD module connections are:
