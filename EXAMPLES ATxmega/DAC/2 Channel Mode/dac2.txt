Sample program to test the ATxmega128A1 DACA in dual
channel mode, using the internal 1V reference.

Use a STK600 development board with STK600-TQFP100 and
STK600-RC100X-13 addapters.

The STK600 programmer must be set in JTAG programming mode
in the Tools|Programmer menu.

Make sure that the VTARGET and VREF voltages are set to 3.6V
using AVR Studio.
The VTARGET LED on the STK600 board must be lighted.

The program can be also run on the Xplain development board.

The following 100Hz, 1V peak to peak, waveforms will be
generated:
- sinusoidal on DACA channel 0 output DAC0 on PORTA pin 2.
- sawtooth on DACA channel 1 output DAC1 on PORTA pin 3.
