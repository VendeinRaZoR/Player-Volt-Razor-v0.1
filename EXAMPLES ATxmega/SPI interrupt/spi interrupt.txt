Example program for interrupt driven SPI slave reception
using an ATxmega128A1 chip running at 2MHz from the internal
2 MHz RC oscillator.

The SPIC peripheral is used as a master to send data to the
SPID peripheral configured as slave.
SPIC performs polled transmission.
SPID performs interrupt driven reception.

Use a STK600 development board with STK600-TQFP100 and
STK600-RC100X-13 addapters.

The STK600 programmer must be set in JTAG programming
mode in the Tools|Programmer menu.

Make sure that the VTARGET and VREF voltages are set
to 3.6V using AVR Studio.
The VTARGET LED on the STK600 board must be lighted.

Make the following connections on the STK600:
PORTA header PA0..7 - LED0..7
PORTC header PC4 (SPIC, /SS)  - PORTD header PD4 (SPID, /SS)
PORTC header PC5 (SPIC, MOSI) - PORTD header PD5 (SPID, MOSI)
PORTC header PC6 (SPIC, MISO) - PORTD header PD6 (SPID, MISO)
PORTC header PC7 (SPIC, SCK)  - PORTD header PD7 (SPID, SCK)

On succesfull reception the LED7 will light.
In case of failure LED0 will light.
